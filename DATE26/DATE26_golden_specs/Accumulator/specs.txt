When valid_in is 1, data_in is a valid input. 
Accumulate four valid input data_in values and calculate the output data_out by adding these four values together. 
There is no output when there are fewer than four data_in inputs in the interim. 
Along with the output data_out, a cycle of valid_out=1 will appear as a signal.
The valid_out signal is set to 1 when the data_out outputs 4 received data accumulation results. 
Otherwise, it is set to 0.
