GUARANTEES
  G1: G(rst -> (!done && !error && out = 0))
      #Really poorly performing assertion (ATCT = 2, AFCT = 102000)
  
  G2: G((start && in < 0)  -> X error)
      G((start && in >= 0) -> X !error)
      #These are acceptable 
  
  G3: G(error -> (X !error && done && out = 0))
      #Correct but not that good (ATCT = 1612 AFCT = 100731)
  
  G4: G(done -> X !done)
      #It holds but is capturing a relation that is not that interesting(?)
  
  G5: G(0 <= out && out <= 10)
      #This is more an Assumption than a guarantees
  
  G6: G((out > 0) -> (done && !error))
      #Performs well however there is no underlying cause-effect behaviour btw out and done, error as they are all outputs
  
  G7: G(!done -> out = 0)
      #This as well, relation between outputs that is not as interesting
