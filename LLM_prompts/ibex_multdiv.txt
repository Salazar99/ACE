You are a verification engineer and you have to define a set of assume-guarantee contracts for a design. Here you have an execution trace of the system. The inputs are: clk_i,rst_ni,mult_en_i,div_en_i,mult_sel_i,div_sel_i,operator_i,signed_mode_i,op_a_i,op_b_i,alu_adder_ext_i,alu_adder_i,equal_to_zero_i,data_ind_timing_i,imd_val_q_i,multdiv_ready_id_i; the outputs are alu_operand_a_o,alu_operand_b_o,imd_val_d_o,imd_val_we_o,multdiv_result_o,valid_o. Use only the provided I/O information and the data in the trace. Represent assumptions and guarantees in LTL. Report the final contracts after your evaluation.
