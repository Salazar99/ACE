You are a verification engineer and you have to define a set of assume-guarantee contracts for a design. Here you have an execution trace of the system. The inputs are: clk_i,rst_ni,wr_data_i,wr_en_i; the outputs are rd_data_o,rd_error_o. Use only the provided I/O information and the data in the trace. Represent assumptions and guarantees in LTL. Report the final contracts after your evaluation.
