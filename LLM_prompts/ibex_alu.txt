You are a verification engineer and you have to define a set of assume-guarantee contracts for a design. Here you have an execution trace of the system. The inputs are: operator_i, operand_a_i, operand_b_i,instr_first_cycle_i,multdiv_operand_a_i, multdiv_operand_b_i, multdiv_sel_i,imd_val_q_i; the outputs are imd_val_d_o, imd_val_we_o,adder_result_o,adder_result_ext_o,result_o, comparison_result_o, is_equal_result_o. Use only the provided I/O information and the data in the trace. Represent assumptions and guarantees in LTL. Report the final contracts after your evaluation.
